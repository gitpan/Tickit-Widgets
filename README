NAME
    `Tickit::Widgets' - load several Tickit::Widget classes at once

SYNOPSIS
     use Tickit::Widgets qw( Static VBox HBox );

    Equivalent to

     use Tickit::Widget::Static;
     use Tickit::Widget::VBox;
     use Tickit::Widget::HBox;

DESCRIPTION
    This module provides an `import' utility to simplify code that uses many
    different Tickit::Widget subclasses. Instead of a `use' line per module,
    you can simply `use' this module and pass it the base name of each
    class. It will `require' each of the modules.

    Note that because each Widget module should be a pure object class with
    no exports, this utility does not run the `import' method of the used
    classes.
