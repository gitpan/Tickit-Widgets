=head1 NAME

C<Tickit::Widget::Placegrid> - a placeholder grid display

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This class provides a widget which displays a simple grid pattern in its
display area, and prints the size of the area in its centre.

It is intended as a placeholder for other widget code while applications are
under development. It easily allows a container to have a child that can take
any size, and will keep its window area painted (so avoiding bugs caused by
"empty" containers that do not clear unused child areas).

=head1 STYLE

The default style pen is used as the widget pen. The following style pen
prefixes are also used:

=over 4

=item grid => PEN

The pen used to render the grid lines
